# PVKII Scripts
This repository contains decrypted weapon and class scripts for PVKII retail build.

# FAQ:
### How to enable modded scripts?
Set CVAR `mp_allow_custom_balance 1` to allow custom weapon/class scripts, reload map to take effect. Please note this will flag your server as 'modded'.

### Can I convert these to .ctx files?
No, the purpose of this repository is to make modding easier, not to replace the vanilla configuration.

# Contributing:
This is a read-only repository mirroring changes from retail builds, you can still open an issue/PR to propose changes, we'll take a look.
